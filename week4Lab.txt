Sunday Times Teaser 3132 of 20th October 2022, Bilateral Symmetry by Susan Bricket,
was as follows.
My son, at a loose end after A-levels, asked me for a mental challenge, As we’d been
discussing palindromes, I suggested he try to find an arrangement of the digits 1 to
9 with the multiplication symbol “x” to give a palindrome as the answer, and he
came up with 29678x1453 = 43122134. I said “Now try to find the smallest such
palindromic product starting in 4, where the last digit of the smallest number is still
3. He found that smallest product, and, interestingly, if he added the two smaller
numbers instead of multiplying them, then added 100, he also go a palindrome.
What was the smallest product?
The solution given by the newspaper was 40699604 (= 1769548 × 23).
